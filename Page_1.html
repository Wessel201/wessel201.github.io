<p> This is my product dedicated to my personal project. During the course of the personal project, it was my goal to explore the techniques and tools employed by the companies to sell their products. With as global context Globalization and sustainability focussing on Markets, commodities, and commercialisation. I think my goal fits within this global context because companies and markets are the drivers of globalization. For example one of the major reason the European union was founded was to create a single market, which brought a lot of economic benefits. Another example; if a new oil spot is found anywhere in the world, everyone would feel the effects, since oil prices will decline to make things like the price of gasoline cheaper. the reason I choose this topic is because i have always been interested in economy like subjects like stock markets and marketing. I found that personal project was great way to expand my knowledge on this topic. My research consist of 2 parts first i started gathering knowledge by reading articles, reports and watching documentaries and then a second part where I applied  and tested all my new learned techniques by persuading people to join the Gooische run and thereby supporting Fight Cancer (More about fight Cancer bellow). As my final product i have decided  to make a website partly because i always wanted to learn coding and this was a great opportunity to do so but mainly because I think that a website is a great way to communicate my research finding in a organised manner.
