    <p>I started this project by gathering as much information about marketing, advertising and promotion as i could by researching on the web, watching documentaries etc. Once i had quite a lot of information, i started narrowing down to focus my research only on advertisement and marketing techniques for small companies.</p>

<p>I wanted to apply my new learned techniques and put them to the test, which were effective, which were not as good and which is method is the cheapest, however I don’t own a business and don’t sell any products, therefore i found this the perfect opportunity to do something good with my new learned knowledge. So I was going to help the Fight Cancer foundation by convincing people to run and donate to Fight Cancer foundation. The only problem was that this was not really a product so it may have been harder, however the process stayed almost the same, therefore I could still evaluate which methods worked and which did not.</p>

<p>I was lucky because I was able to obtain Posters and Flyers for the run, which meant i did not have to make them myself. The problem with posters and flyers is that you cannot really measure your success, so it is just a prediction that they did well. One of the best method that certainly did well was my Facebook post. That post raised more then 150 euro for the run.</p>
<p>
Eventually i also did the run myself, which was harder then i initially thought. The run was 4 miles but the fact that I was running for a good purpose certainly helped. It was a fun experience helping Fight Cancer
